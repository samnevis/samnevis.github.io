## About Me

Hi! I'm **Sam Khoshnevis**, a computer science student based in Vancouver, BC. I have a passion for building efficient software solutions and applying artificial intelligence in real-world scenarios. In my free time, I enjoy altruism, games, and puzzles, and I'm always looking to deepen my knowledge of computer science and artificial intelligence.

With a solid foundation in programming and AI, I am eager to take on new challenges and contribute to impactful projects. My work experiences have provided me with valuable skills in software development, tutoring, and leading discussions on effective altruism.

## Effective Altruism

In pursuit of helping others as much as I can, I have become very engaged with Effective Altruism (EA). In highschool, I have fundraised for Hellen Keller's Vitamin A Supplementation program and I am currently the lead organizer of UBC Effective Altruism. Come check out EA UBC and Vancouver on our combined [discord](https://discord.gg/r2ntupNFpF)
