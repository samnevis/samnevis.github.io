## About Me

Hi! I'm **Sam Khoshnevis**, a computer science student based in Vancouver, BC. I have a passion for building efficient software solutions and applying artificial intelligence in real-world scenarios. In my free time, I enjoy altruism, games, and puzzles, and I'm always looking to deepen my knowledge of computer science and artificial intelligence.

With a solid foundation in programming and AI, I am eager to take on new challenges and contribute to impactful projects. My work experiences have provided me with valuable skills in software development, tutoring, and leading discussions on effective altruism.
